For me, it\u2019s like a temperature check for the industry - assessing what people are searching for, spotting the shifting tides of the market, and getting a peek into how the collective mindset around technical writing is evolving.\\n\\nSo, Recently, during an interview, I was hit with this question: \u201cHow can technical writers create accurate documentation if they didn\u2019t develop the product themselves?\u201d\\n\\nThis question struck a chord with me because it touches on a core aspect of our craft. But if you peel back the layers, it really asks, \u201cWhat makes a great technical writer?\u201d\\n\\nWith that in mind, I\'d like to share some of my own insights on the topic.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## TL;DR\\n\\nIt\'s **not** all about knowing how to code. \\nWhile diving into programming can broaden your expertise, it can also turn into a double-edged sword. The pressure to master every line of code can lead to burnout faster than you can say \u201csyntax error.\u201d\\n\\nWhat **does** make a difference is: \\n- asking the right questions\\n- knowing the very basics\\n- being ready to rounds of review and corrections\\n- willing to orginize some mess\\n- knowing how to write and enjoying the process\\n\\n## Knowing the basics\\n\\nYou don\u2019t need to be a Java or C++ wizard to be a good tech writer. Sure, it\u2019s a nice bonus, but it\u2019s not the must have.\\n\\nHowever, what is a must have (imho) is knowing the basic concepts of programming. Think of it like knowing the rules of the road even if you\u2019re not the one driving.\\n\\n- What types of architectural approaches are there?\\n- Which popular languages are used for which purposes?\\n- What are databases? Which tools for managing them are popular nowadays?\\n- What is UML? How do I create a diagram on my own? What tools can I use?\\n- What is an API? How is it used?\\n\\nThis is the most basic information that can help you on every project.\\n\\n### Research and read\\n\\nTo build this foundation, you could take the scenic route with books like *\\"Software Architecture in Practice\\"* by Len Bass, Paul Clements, and Rick Kazman, or \\"Database Systems: The Complete Book\\" by Hector Garcia-Molina, Jeffrey D. Ullman, and Jennifer Widom. Or even take a course \\"Documenting APIs: A guide for technical writers and engineers\\n\\" by Tom Johnson.\\nBut these days, I more up to using ChatGPT, taking Udemy courses, or reading articels on Medium. It\u2019s all about finding what fits your style.\\n\\nLeverage every resource at your disposal to know the basics. If you\u2019re already in the trenches as a tech writer, don\u2019t hesitate to ask your SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) for reading recommendations.  I once asked and was floored by the sheer volume of incredible suggestions that came my way.\\n\\n## Ability to write and enjoying the process\\n\\nI believe, this is the top skill of a good tech writer. You could be an exceptional programmer, but if you can\u2019t clearly articulate your knowledge in writing, those skills might become more of a hindrance than a help. It\u2019s essential to have a passion for writing, along with the ability to distill complex information into clear, concise text. Without this, the burden of knowing too much without being able to effectively communicate it can drive you up the wall.\\n\\n## Askig the right questions\\n\\nThis is a skill that grows with you. I think, upon every other item in this list, this is one of the second most crutial for the tech writer after ability to write and passion for that.\\n\\n**Your questions define the qulity of your documentation.**\\n\\nThere are days when I feel like a detective piecing together a complex puzzle. It starts with digging into everything I can find on the subject, then evolves into an interactive investigation during conversations with SMEs or stakeholders. I gather my questions, toss them out during discussions, and jot down every answer and idea that comes my way.  I always record or write down the answers or the related ideas.\\n\\nSometimes, after a call, I have that feeling that some parts of my puzzle are missing and I can\'t identify them explicitly at first glance. That\u2019s when I turn to mind mapping [a mindmap](./2024-07-16-mindmaps/2024-07-16-long-blog-post.md) to capture all details I have to create some sort of a brain dump. Oftentimes, during this process, I can identify some of the questions that I missed, which I can then address in the next round.\\n\\nAsking the right questions isn\u2019t always easy. It\'s not always obvious to me what the right question is, or which information is \\"additional\\" or \\"extra. Sometimes I just try until I get this feeling of a \\"hey, this is my missing puzzle!\\". And when you reel in that one piece that completes the puzzle, it\u2019s incredibly satisfying.\\n\\n## Proofread and review\\n\\nIt might sound like a no-brainer, but sending your work out for review is essential. Getting fresh eyes on your documentation \u2014 whether from SMEs or fellow tech writers \u2014 can be interesting and useful.  You can sometimes get really surprised of how many findings, corrections, and enchansments you can get. XD\\n\\nI always value feedback, even when it stings a bit. My mantra here is \\"it sharpens my skills and helps me grow as a professional\\".\\n\\n![Confluence comments I sometimes get](../static/img/comment-confluence.png)\\n\\nAnd here we are, ready to **level up**.\\n\\n## Becoming an advocate for documentation\\nThis is where you elevate your role from a good technical writer to an exceptional one. I know, it\'s a tricky one. I\u2019m fortunate to be in such an environment now, where ideas for improving processes and tools are always welcomed.\\nBut there were different times...\\n\\nUnfortunately, that\u2019s not always the case. Sometimes, it feels like an uphill battle to change existing processes or shift the way coworkers perceive documentation.\\n\\nBe patient, write your ideas on paper, confluence pages or whatever text editor you have in mind.\\nJust don\'t abandon them. Engage with the SMEs involved in documentation. Together, you might just spark changes that elevate the entire process, and one day, you\u2019ll see the quality of your documentation soar."},{"id":"i-don\'t-like-tech-writing","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/i-don\'t-like-tech-writing","editUrl":"https://github.com/mariiapodavalkina/docusaurus-docs.git/blog/2024-07-29-i-dont-like-tw/2024-07-29-i-dont-like-tw.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-29-i-dont-like-tw/2024-07-29-i-dont-like-tw.md","title":"What I Don\'t Like About Tech Writing","description":"Sometimes, certain aspects of tech writing really frustrate me.

We all have our good and bad days at work, and there are things we love and hate about our jobs.\\n\\nAs they say \\"I\'m only human, after all\\"...  So, I want to freely express my thoughts here.\\n\\nSo today, I\'m about to discuss with you some of the things that drive me nuts about my job, based on my experiences and those of fellow tech writers.\\n\\n![Boom!](./mindblow.png)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n# TL;DR\\n\\nIt\'s all about collaboration. People can boost your development as a professional and bring joy to your everyday work, but can also be the main source of stress.  So let\'s treat others with respect. \\n\\n# Firstly...\\n\\n...it\'s when people don\'t want to understand what a tech writer does. They assign so many things to you as so the \\"writer\\" part of you job title includes being their personal scribe, translator, email writing assistant, reference searcher, grammar checker, english teacher, and so on and so forth. \\n\\nI understand, that the role of a tech writer can include multiple totally different responsibilities, and that\'s perfectly fine. I like being able to switch between different intesting and new tasks.\\nAnd I get that, if someone from your team needs help formulating a text, and you\'re willing to help, it\'s a win-win situation.\\nBut if you\'re constantly being assigned the tasks you\'re not supposed to do (even if you shared your concerns), that\'s where it becomes a problem.\\n\\n## But you\'re a writer, right?\\n\\nYes, I\'m indeed a writer. A person who writes tech documentation (whatever that is in your mind).\\nSo mainly, what I do first whenever I land on the a new project, list out all the main things that I can help with if I feel the need for this.\\n\\nPlease, pay attention and listen closely.  This helps avoid unnecessary discussions later. (Yes, I do have a list somewhere in a text file.)\\n\\n\\n# Secondly...\\n\\n...it\'s being totally ignored when you need input.\\n\\nAbout 90% of my work involves interviewing people to get the data to document. I don\'t write to bother you; I write because it\'s my job.\\n\\nThis is this point that I desparately try to overcome, but still can\'t stand.\\nDon\'t get me wrong, I don\'t bombard people with countless messages, but constantly being the lowest priority on colleagues\' to-do lists is discouraging.\\n\\nI can read code,  but I might not understand the underlying idea sometimes. Also, if I\'m about to document a new feature not yet implemented, dear SME, you\'re my only source of informaion, so please consider this when developing something that (ideally) needs to be written up.\\n\\nI\'m not a fan of meetings myself. I believe that most meetings lasting over 2 hours could be just replaced with an email and a 30-minute discussion max.\\n\\nBut part of my job is getting information from developers and explaining it through documentation.\\nSo please, if you are busy, at least say when we can come back to the conversation. Please don\'t leave me waiting endlessly for your response. Let\'s respect each other\'s time after all.\\n\\n# Thirdly...\\n\\n...it\'s not being included in discussions about new features or enchantsments. How am I supposed to know the details from meetings I wasn\'t invited to because they were \\"technical discussions\\"?\\n\\nI\'m not a mind reader. And based on the previous point, the details I need have likely already slipped away because explaining them to me is a low priority.\\n\\nWell, I don\'t even know what\'s more to add.\\n\\nBut wait..I actually have something.\\n\\n# In Addition\\n\\nDiscussions with my fellow tech writers brought up even more light on the issues. Sadly, it\'s not the first time I heard those stories. For example:\\n\\nBeing treated like a child who can\'t think properly. Yes, I may not always grasp the details on the first or second try, but acting superior about it is inappropriate.\\n\\nOr even worse:  \\"We\'ve already talked about this; what\'s so hard to understand?\\".\\nThis is one of the most inappropriate phrases I ever heard. I\'m glad I no longer work in a place where this was acceptable.\\n\\n\\nTo my fellow tech writers who\'ve experienced this, don\'t allow yourself to be treated like a dummy. Speak up and never stay silent. If things don\'t improve, it might be time to find a project where you\'re treated with the respect you deserve."},{"id":"mindmaps","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/mindmaps","editUrl":"https://github.com/mariiapodavalkina/docusaurus-docs.git/blog/2024-07-16-mindmaps/2024-07-16-long-blog-post.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-16-mindmaps/2024-07-16-long-blog-post.md","title":"Crafting Effective Mindmaps for Mastering the Unknown","description":"Technical writers often write about topics they don\u2019t deeply understand.

This is both a plus and a challenging curse of our job.\\n\\nA plus, because it allows us to get acquainted with a multitude of new concepts, try out innovative products, and explore the tech world extensively. **Being there when new things in IT are being created** \u2014 that\'s what I personally love the most about tech writing.\\n\\nAnd why the curse? It\'s because this approach involves a constant feeling of uncertainty and the nagging realization that \\"I don\'t understand anything at all, omg!\\".\\n\\nYou always need to ask a lot of questions, place yourself in the learner\'s mindset, and continuously feel the pressure to keep up and figure everything out. And deadlines often demand that you do this really quickly.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nSo, here I share my tips and insights on how I gather information and organize it, so I don\u2019t forget the details and can write documentation faster (not worrying so much about the amount of the Unknown).\\n\\n## The curse of a blank page\\n\\nStarting from scratch can be tough. We\'ve all been there\u2014staring at a blank page, feeling frustrated or overwhelmed as we try to start writing. To get myself moving, I use braindumps to jot down all the facts I have, organizing them to prepare for the next steps. This makes the process much less intimidating for me.\\n\\nWhat do I use?\\n\\n## Mindmaps to the rescue!\\n\\nThe main thing that helps me most these days is a **mindmap**.\\nA mindmap is a fantastic tool that visually organizes information.\\n\\n![Mindmap Example](./mindmap.jpg)\\n\\nWhen I listen to stakeholders or attend a knowledge-sharing meeting, I always come prepared. I bring a mindmap template with me, and each time a new idea pops up, I jot it down in my mindmap. If I don\u2019t have enough time during the meeting, I write all my thoughts and ideas immediately afterward while they are still fresh in my memory.\\nThe main idea here is to keep all the major details in the mindmap. This makes it easier for me to move on to the breakdown phase.\\n\\n## OK, and what\u2019s next?\\nAfter creating the mindmap, I usually analyze the results and then break this information into hierarchical chunks. It\u2019s not always obvious how to best organize the information, but often the mindmap itself can help you with that by visually representing the topics and their connections.\\nAt the very least, it helps structure the chaos in your head after a knowledge-sharing meeting. \ud83d\ude05\\n\\n## What are the tools? \\nOh, there are plenty!\\n\\nThe one I use most is **Xmind**. Although, in most cases, there were no macros available for displaying the files in Confluence, it\u2019s a super easy-to-use and convenient tool. I love that you can pick from a variety of preset styles whenever you like\u2014even when you\u2019re almost done with all the blocks. It\u2019s like giving your work a fun makeover at the last minute.\ud83d\udd06\\n\\nAlso, **drawio** is a good choice. There are different macros available for Confluence.\\n\\n**Miro** is another tool I\'ve used a couple of times at work. It has a macro and allows easy collaboration with the team (they might have something to add to your mindmaps), and you can track all changes and history.\\n\\nI\u2019ve also tried **Figma Jamboard** a few times. It\u2019s a nice tool, although it has some restrictions on user collaboration. But if you\'re using the mindmaps solely for yourself, that\u2019s not a problem at all.\\n\\n\\n## Anyways...\\nYou can try this out next time you have a meeting where you need to grasp a new topic for documenting. I\'m sure it will be fun\u2014at the very least, you\'ll have an opportunity to play around with colors and shapes. \ud83d\ude43"},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/mariiapodavalkina/docusaurus-docs.git/blog/2024-05-20-welcome/2024-05-20-welcome.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-05-20-welcome/2024-05-20-welcome.md","title":"Welcome","description":"I\'m Mariia, a tech writer from Ukraine.
