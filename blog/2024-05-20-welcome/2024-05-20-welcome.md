# Hey, nice to meet you here! Welcome to my blog! 

**I'm Mariia, a tech writer from Ukraine.** I'm lucky to have a diverse background in end-user documentation and internal documentation for developers.
Over the years, I've had the pleasure of working on various projects: healthcare to retail, IoT, and more.
I like documentation. My mission is to create a bridge of understanding between people through my texts.

Beyond my passion for writing, I'm also a passionate musician. Music fuels my creativity and inspires my work.
I also have the privilege learning different languages, such as English, German, Slovak, Spanish, and French, which allows me to connect with a wider audience and understand different perspectives.🌉

# What is this blog about?

I hope you'll like it! 😇
